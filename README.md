Introduction:

The entire idea is to make the entire poison-buying process as simple, fast, and brainless as possible. It doesn't make you bother with ranks or anything - it assumes you want to refill your highest-rank poison to a threshold you set.

How to use:

    Right-click to set the number of poisons you want to automatically buy and make.
    Left-click to buy the exact amount of components for your poisons needs. Hemlock also keep track of your inventory so it won't buy more reagents than needed!
    Left-click again to automatically craft your poisons. alt textThe number of poisons in your inventory appears in red is when the threshold is not reached and green are when you already have enough poisons.

/hemlock reset to show all poisons and reagents buttons or use the ingame addon option menu.

Lacking Features, Ideas & Problems

The "ignore old poisons in inventory" option is not working properly, this is due to hemlock not knowing what poison rank you can craft when you open the vendor window.
